# Assignment 2: The Contactor

This is the second assignment in the App Design course (T-488-MAPP).
It's a simple contacts app used for storing and calling contacts.

## Setup

Navigate to the directory of the project

Run

`npm install`

## Running

Run

`npm start`

Make sure to use a mobile device (iOS or Android). This application does not support browser viewing.

## Interpretations

We interpreted the line:

> The user is stored on the format described in the assignment description: with each properties populated

to mean that no contact could be added if they had missing properties, so we added validation.
